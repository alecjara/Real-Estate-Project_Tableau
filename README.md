# Real Estate Project with Tableau

This project explores different visualization techniques in Tableau for analyzing real estate sales data.  
It demonstrates how to build and interpret a variety of charts, including:

- Horizontal, stacked, and side-by-side bar charts  
- Tree maps for hierarchical comparisons  
- Circle views and side-by-side circle views  
- Area charts for trends over time  

Each visualization highlights how different chart types can reveal insights such as sales distribution by zip code, property type, and overall market trends.
